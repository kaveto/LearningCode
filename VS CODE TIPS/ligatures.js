// Fira Code: mono-spaced font with programming ligatures

 // From the Fira Code developer
 // Programmers use a lot of symbols, often encoded with several characters. Ideally, all programming languages should be designed with full-fledged Unicode symbols for operators, but thatâ€™s not the case yet.
 
UseFontLigatures()
{
 // Fira Code is based on Fira Mono
 // It provides a nice contrast on ambiguous characters

 // I vs l vs | vs 1, O vs 0
 // braces []{}()

  var x = 10;

  // ==, === => -> :=
  if (x==20)
  {
    

    if (x===30){;}
    x++ ;
    if (x!=40){;}

  
  }
